# QGIS ERMES Connector plugin
A QGIS plugin to integrate with the ERMES Earth Observation (EO) platform from Links Foundation. Request and automatically load on-demand emergency maps directly as QGIS layers.



## About the Plugin
The ERMES Connector provides a direct bridge between the QGIS desktop environment and the ERMES Earth Observation (EO) processing platform. It enables GIS analysts, researchers, and emergency managers to task powerful remote EO models for crisis management and environmental analysis without leaving their GIS workspace.
The workflow is simple: define an area of interest, select a processing pipeline, and send the request. The plugin works asynchronously in the background, listening for the result and automatically downloading and loading the final map into your QGIS project upon completion.
