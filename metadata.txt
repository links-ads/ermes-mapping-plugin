about=This plugin provides a direct bridge between the QGIS desktop environment and the ERMES Earth Observation (EO) processing platform, developed by Links Foundation. It enables users to task powerful EO models for emergency management and environmental analysis without leaving their GIS workspace. Define an Area of Interest (AOI) using a polygon layer, specify a time range, and select a processing pipeline (e.g., Burned Area Delineation, Burn Severity Estimation). The plugin sends the request and asynchronously listens for the result, automatically downloading and loading the final emergency map as a new layer in your QGIS project.
